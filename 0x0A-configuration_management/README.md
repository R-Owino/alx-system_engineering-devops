## Configuration Management

### Puppet
* Open-source software configuration management tool used to manage infrastructre, automate tasks and ensure consistency across systems using code.
* Using Puppet, you can define the desired state of the infrastructure in code and it will automatically ensure that the infrastructure matches the state.
* Puppet uses a declarative language, that is, you define resources such as files, packages and services and it handles the details of how to install, confugure and manage those resources on the infrastructure.
* It consists of:
	* Master server that stores the configuration code
	* One or more agents that supply the configuration code to the infrastructure.
