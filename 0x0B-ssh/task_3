# Add the provided public key to the server

# Connect to the server using ssh with the ubuntu user
ssh ubuntu@54.236.33.113

# Add the public key to the authorized_keys file
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo "PROVIDED_PUBLIC_KEY" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

* The -p option tells mkdir to create any necessary parent directories along the path as well.
* So, if the .ssh directory doesn't exist, the -p option ensures that both the .ssh directory and its parent directory (i.e., your home directory) are created.
