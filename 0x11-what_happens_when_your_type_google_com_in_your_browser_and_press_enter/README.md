## What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

<p>Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.</p>

<p>A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.</p>

<p>Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.</p>

<p>In this project, I was tasked with writing a blog post that explains wha happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter. The post must cover:
	
	* DNS request
	* TCP/IP
	* Firewall
	* HTTPS/SSL
	* Load-balancer
	* Web server
	* Application server
	* Database
(This)[https://blvckrose.hashnode.dev/what-happens-when-you-type-googlecom-in-your-browser-and-press-enter] is the blog post I wrote.</p>
